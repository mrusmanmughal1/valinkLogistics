### Importance Things

- [ ] Logos should be finalize ASAP.
- [ ] Van Image should be finalize ASAP.
- [ ] All API routes should be defined in .env file.

### Bugs Needs to fixed ASAP

- [x] Calculator Gives, wrong calculation. For exmaple distance between DY2 to EH11 is 294 miles and with small van price should be £237 but right now I'm getting £264
- [x] Price displayed on calculator should be in £ not in \$ currency.
- [x] Sign Up button in Service page should redirect client to the registration request portal/Client Area.
- [x] Google Map location should be updated to this address Vanlink , 4th floors, 84 Salop St, Wolverhampton.
- [x] Van name is not appearing on the job request form.
- [ ] Phone Number should not be redirected to 404 page. You can turn it into unclickable or you could use calling action.

### Things to Add

- [x] Full Post codes should be filled automatically just like Selected Van in Job request form.
- [x] Trusted Partner Coursel should rotate after small interval of time.
